# Adult-Income-Analysis

In this project, we aim to predict whether an individual earns over $50,000 per year or not, based on their demographic and employment information. This classification task is important in understanding the factors that influence income and reducing income inequality.

## Data
We used the Adult Income dataset, which contains demographic and employment information of individuals in the United States. The dataset consists of 48,842 instances, with each instance containing 14 attributes such as age, education level, occupation, and marital status. The dataset was obtained from https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/adult.
